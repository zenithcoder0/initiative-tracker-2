Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
If youâ€™ve stumbled upon this tool, feel free to use it â€” it was built with the tabletop gaming community in mind.

This project is something I quickly put together using a mix of AI assistance and personal iteration. 
I wonâ€™t claim it as a demonstration of expert-level skill, but rather as a learning tool and a small utility that grew out of passion for gaming and experimentation with code.

I hope it helps you manage your combat initiative so you can focus more on enjoying the game.
Feel free to fork it, improve it, or completely remix it â€” make it your own!

Thanks for checking it out
